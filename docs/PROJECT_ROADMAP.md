- **Risk:** User adoption
  - **Mitigation:** Simple UI, comprehensive training

- **Risk:** Data migration
  - **Mitigation:** Build import tools early, test with sample data

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Initialize git repository with project structure
3. Create database schema
4. Begin Sprint 1 with EPIC-01 tasks

## How to Use These Documents
1. Each epic has its own detailed file in `/docs/epics/`
2. Tasks can be created as GitHub issues from these documents
3. Use the checkbox lists to track progress
4. Update status and notes as work progresses
