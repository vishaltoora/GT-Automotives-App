# GT Automotive App Documentation

## What's Been Created

Since the GitHub token didn't have the necessary permissions to create issues directly, I've created a complete project structure with all epics and tasks as markdown files.

### Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── README.md (this file)
├── PROJECT_ROADMAP.md - Complete project overview and timeline
├── epics/ - All 7 epic descriptions
│   ├── EPIC-01-project-setup.md
│   ├── EPIC-02-user-authentication.md
│   ├── EPIC-03-tire-inventory.md
│   ├── EPIC-04-customer-management.md
│   ├── EPIC-05-invoicing-system.md
│   ├── EPIC-06-appointment-scheduling.md
│   └── EPIC-07-reporting-dashboard.md
└── tasks/ - Sample task descriptions
    ├── TASK-01-01-initialize-project.md
    └── TASK-01-02-setup-database.md

scripts/
└── create-github-issues.sh - Script to create GitHub issues
```

## How to Use These Files

### Option 1: Fix GitHub Token and Run Script
1. Create a new GitHub token with proper permissions:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Create token with `repo`, `write:issues`, and `project` scopes
2. Update your GitHub CLI authentication:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Run the provided script:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./create-github-issues.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Manual GitHub Issue Creation
1. Go to https://github.com/vishaltoora/GT-Automotives-App/issues
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Copy content from each epic file in `docs/epics/`
4. Create issues with appropriate labels

### Option 3: Use as Project Documentation
- Keep these markdown files in your repository
- Update checkboxes as tasks are completed
- Use for team reference and planning

## Next Steps
1. **Fix GitHub Token Permissions** to enable issue creation

- **4 Development Phases** over 10 weeks

All epic and task descriptions include:
- Clear acceptance criteria

- Priority levels
- Technical details where applicable

This structure provides a complete roadmap for building your GT Automotive application from scratch to MVP.
