# GT Automotive App Documentation

## What's Been Created

Since the GitHub token didn't have the necessary permissions to create issues directly, I've created a complete project structure with all epics and tasks as markdown files.

### Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── README.md (this file)
├── PROJECT_ROADMAP.md - Complete project overview and timeline
├── ROLE_PERMISSIONS.md - Detailed role-based access control matrix
├── epics/ - All 8 epic descriptions
│   ├── EPIC-01-project-setup.md
│   ├── EPIC-02-user-authentication.md (Updated: 3-role system)
│   ├── EPIC-03-tire-inventory.md

│   ├── EPIC-05-invoicing-system.md (Updated: printing capabilities)
│   ├── EPIC-06-appointment-scheduling.md

└── tasks/ - Sample task descriptions

    ├── TASK-01-02-setup-database.md
    └── TASK-05-01-invoice-printing.md (NEW)

scripts/
└── create-github-issues.sh - Script to create GitHub issues
```

## How to Use These Files

### Option 1: Fix GitHub Token and Run Script
1. Create a new GitHub token with proper permissions:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Create token with `repo`, `write:issues`, and `project` scopes
2. Update your GitHub CLI authentication:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Run the provided script:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./create-github-issues.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Manual GitHub Issue Creation
1. Go to https://github.com/vishaltoora/GT-Automotives-App/issues
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Copy content from each epic file in `docs/epics/`
4. Create issues with appropriate labels

### Option 3: Use as Project Documentation
- Keep these markdown files in your repository
- Update checkboxes as tasks are completed
- Use for team reference and planning

## Project Summary

### Three User Interfaces
1. **Customer Portal:** Self-service for appointments, invoices, and service history
2. **Technician/Sales Dashboard:** Operational tools for daily business
3. **Owner/Manager Admin:** Full control with analytics and management

### Version 1.0 Features
- **Three-Role Authentication:** Customer, Staff (Tech/Sales), Admin (Owner/Manager)
- **Tire Inventory:** Track new and used tires with conditions and photos
- **Customer Management:** Customer profiles with vehicle information
- **Professional Invoicing:** Create and print invoices (8.5x11, thermal, PDF)
- **Appointments:** Calendar-based scheduling with reminders
- **Customer Portal:** Self-service access for customers
- **Reports:** Daily sales, inventory, monthly summaries (role-based access)

### Timeline
- **Total Duration:** 12 weeks
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3):** Setup and Three-Role Authentication
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-7):** Core Features (Inventory & Customers)
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 8-10):** Business Operations (Invoicing & Appointments)
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 11-12):** Customer Portal & Analytics

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React or Vue.js with role-based routing
- Backend: Node.js/Express or Django
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Authentication: JWT with role claims
- PDF Generation: PDFKit or similar
- Email: SendGrid or AWS SES
- SMS: Twilio

## Next Steps
1. **Fix GitHub Token Permissions** to enable issue creation
2. **Initialize the codebase** with the project structure
3. **Set up development environment**
4. **Begin with EPIC-01** tasks

## Total Work Items
- **8 Epics** covering all major features
- **75+ Tasks** broken down from epics
- **4 Development Phases** over 12 weeks
- **3 User Roles** with distinct interfaces

All epic and task descriptions include:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies
- Time estimates
- Priority levels
- Technical details where applicable

This structure provides a complete roadmap for building your GT Automotive application from scratch to MVP.
