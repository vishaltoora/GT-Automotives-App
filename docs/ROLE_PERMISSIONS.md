## Security Implementation Notes

1. **JWT Token Structure**
   - Include role claim in JWT
   - Validate role on every API request
   - Implement role-specific token expiration

2. **API Middleware**
   - Create role validation middleware
   - Implement data filtering based on role
   - Log all admin actions for audit trail

3. **Database Considerations**
   - Add role field to users table
   - Create audit log table for admin actions
   - Implement row-level security where applicable

4. **Frontend Guards**
   - Implement route guards based on role
   - Hide/show UI elements based on permissions
   - Redirect unauthorized access attempts

## Business Rules

1. **Customer Data Isolation**
   - Customers can only see their own data
   - No cross-customer data visibility
   - Email verification required for registration

2. **Staff Limitations**
   - Cannot view financial totals/profits
   - Cannot modify prices or tax rates
   - Limited discount authority (e.g., max 10%)

3. **Admin Oversight**
   - All admin actions are logged
   - Can impersonate other users for support
   - Has emergency override capabilities

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Basic role separation (Customer vs Staff/Admin)
2. **Phase 2**: Full three-role implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Granular permissions within roles
4. **Phase 4**: Custom role creation capability (future)
