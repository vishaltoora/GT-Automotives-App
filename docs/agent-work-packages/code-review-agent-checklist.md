- [ ] README files updated
- [ ] JSDoc comments where needed

### API Documentation
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI updated
- [ ] Example requests provided
- [ ] Error responses documented
- [ ] Authentication documented
- [ ] Rate limits documented

## 8. Specific Validations

### Role-Based Checks
```typescript
// Verify these scenarios:
Customer:
- âœ“ Can view tire list (no cost)
- âœ“ Can view tire details (no cost)
- âœ— Cannot create/edit/delete
- âœ— Cannot adjust stock
- âœ— Cannot see reports

Staff:
- âœ“ Can view all tire data (no cost)
- âœ“ Can create/edit tires
- âœ“ Can adjust stock
- âœ— Cannot delete tires
- âœ— Cannot see cost/reports

Admin:
- âœ“ Full access to all features
- âœ“ Can see cost and profit
- âœ“ Can delete tires
- âœ“ Can view reports
- âœ“ Can export data
```

### Critical Paths
- [ ] Customer can browse tires
- [ ] Staff can add new tire
- [ ] Staff can adjust stock
- [ ] Admin can view inventory value
- [ ] Low stock alerts work
- [ ] Image upload works

## 9. Deployment Readiness

### Environment Variables
- [ ] All env vars documented
- [ ] Defaults for development
- [ ] Production values secured
- [ ] No secrets in code

### Database Migrations
- [ ] Migrations are reversible
- [ ] Migrations tested

## Notes for Review Agent

1. Start with security - it's the highest priority
2. Test with all three user roles
3. Actually run the code, don't just read it
4. Check for regression in existing features
5. Verify against original requirements
6. Consider future maintainability
7. Be constructive in feedback
8. Acknowledge good practices
9. Suggest specific improvements
10. Re-review after fixes
