# Employee Payment Tracking System - Comprehensive Plan

## üìã Analysis Summary

Based on the existing GT Automotive codebase, I've identified:
- ‚úÖ User management system with STAFF role (employees already exist)
- ‚úÖ Invoice system architecture (good template for payment tracking)
- ‚úÖ Audit logging capabilities
- ‚úÖ Role-based permissions system
- ‚úÖ Well-structured API patterns with repositories

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Design

### New Models Required:
