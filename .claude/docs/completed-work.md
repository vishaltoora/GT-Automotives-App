### VITE_API_URL Configuration Fix - Build 164 ✅

**Problem Resolution:**
- **Build 162 Issue:** Production deployment had all API calls failing with 401 Unauthorized errors
- **Root Cause:** `VITE_API_URL=https://gt-automotives-backend-api.azurewebsites.net` (direct backend URL)
- **Impact:** Frontend bypassed reverse proxy, no `X-Internal-API-Key` header added, `InternalApiGuard` blocked all requests

**Investigation Process:**
1. Analyzed console errors showing 401 on `/api/auth/me`, `/api/customers`, etc.
2. Checked `InternalApiGuard` implementation in backend
3. Verified reverse proxy configuration adds `X-Internal-API-Key` header
4. Compared Build 146 (working) vs Build 162 (broken) logs
5. Discovered VITE_API_URL mismatch between builds

**Solution Implemented (Build 164):**
- **Azure Setting Update:** Changed `VITE_API_URL` from backend URL to `https://gt-automotives.com`
- **New Build Trigger:** Created Build 164 with correct VITE configuration
- **Build Identifier:** `build-20251027-142413-1cdc689`
- **Architecture Restored:** Frontend → Reverse Proxy → Backend (with security header)

**Configuration Comparison:**
```bash
# Build 146 (Working) ✅
VITE_API_URL=https://gt-automotives.com
→ Requests go through reverse proxy
→ X-Internal-API-Key header added
→ Backend accepts requests

# Build 162 (Broken) ❌
VITE_API_URL=https://gt-automotives-backend-api.azurewebsites.net
→ Direct backend calls bypass proxy
→ No X-Internal-API-Key header
→ Backend rejects with 401

# Build 164 (Fixed) ✅
VITE_API_URL=https://gt-automotives.com
→ Same as Build 146, fully restored
```

**Key Learnings:**
- VITE environment variables are baked into builds at build time (not runtime)
- Changing Azure settings requires a rebuild to take effect
- Always verify VITE settings match working builds before deploying
- `VITE_API_URL` must use frontend domain (with reverse proxy), not backend URL

**Files Updated:**
- Azure Web App Setting: `VITE_API_URL` in gt-automotives-frontend
- Documentation: `troubleshooting.md` - Added VITE_API_URL section
- Documentation: `completed-work.md` - Added this entry
- Build Trigger: `TRIGGER_BUILD.md` - Documented Build 163 and 164

**Testing Required After Deployment:**
```bash
# Verify frontend uses correct API URL
curl -s https://gt-automotives.com/health | jq

# Test API calls work without 401 errors
# Login to https://gt-automotives.com
# Verify dashboard loads
# Verify customer list loads
# Check browser console for no 401 errors
```

**Prevention Commands:**
```bash
# Check VITE settings before building
az webapp config appsettings list \
  --name gt-automotives-frontend \
  --resource-group gt-automotives-prod \
  --query "[?starts_with(name, 'VITE_')].{name:name, value:value}" -o table

# Verify in build logs
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep "VITE_API_URL:"
```
