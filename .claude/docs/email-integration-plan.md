**Recommended Provider**: Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)
**Estimated Cost**: $0/month (Free tier) ‚Üí $15/month (if scaling needed)

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the integration of transactional email capabilities into the GT Automotives application. After comprehensive research, **Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)** is the recommended provider, offering the best balance of cost, features, and ease of use for our automotive shop use case.

### Why Email Integration?

- **Payment Receipts**: Automated payment confirmations
- **Service Reminders**: Complementary to SMS reminders

### ROI Analysis
- **Cost**: $0/month initially (300 emails/day free tier covers ~9,000 emails/month)
- **Benefit**: Professional communication, reduced phone calls, automatic record-keeping
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Modern, professional communication experience
- **Time Savings**: Automated invoice/quote delivery saves 10-15 minutes per customer

## 8. Domain Setup Requirements

### DNS Records to Add (Namecheap)

Before sending emails, you need to configure these DNS records:

```
1. SPF Record (TXT)
   Host: @
   Value: v=spf1 include:spf.sendinblue.com ~all

2. DKIM Record (TXT)
   Host: mail._domainkey
   Value: (Brevo will provide this after account setup)

3. DMARC Record (TXT)
   Host: _dmarc
   Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@gt-automotives.com
```

These records ensure emails don't go to spam and verify your domain ownership.

---
