      "title": "GT: Check Migration Status",
      "category": "GT Automotives"
    },

}
```

## Error Handling

### Command Validation
- Validate required parameters before execution
- Check database connectivity before operations
- Verify file permissions for script execution
- Provide helpful error messages with next steps

### Fallback Procedures
- If automated commands fail, provide manual instructions
- Show exact shell commands for direct execution
- Provide alternative approaches for complex scenarios
- Include contact information for emergency support

## Security Considerations

### Production Access
- Commands that affect production require confirmation
- Sensitive database URLs are masked in output
- Production operations require explicit user consent
- All production changes are logged and auditable

### Command Permissions
- Development commands: No restrictions
- Staging commands: Require confirmation
- Production commands: Require explicit approval
- Emergency commands: Require admin privileges

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Git Hooks
- Pre-commit: Auto-run `/migration check`
- Pre-push: Auto-run `/migration validate`
- Post-merge: Auto-run `/migration status`

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Build stage: Run `/migration validate`
- Deploy stage: Run `/migration deploy`
- Post-deploy: Run `/migration status`

### Monitoring Integration
- Failed migrations trigger alerts
- Schema drift detection sends notifications
- Production deployment status updates stakeholders
